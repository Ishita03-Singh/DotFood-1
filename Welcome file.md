<p>Food Insecurity And Hunger In India Is Always Been A major Issue and the sudden imposition of  lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed focus on the problems of hunger and food insecurity.  With a sudden loss of livelihoods, a vast majority of India’s poor are faced with increased food insecurity, hunger and starvation. A number of starvation deaths have also been reported.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea">The idea</h3>
<p>With our project we are providing a platform for the organization and communities to directly contact  the food providers or food takers  and amplify your requirement on the same so that food can be provided to poor in efficient way.</p>

<p>The main thought process behind this idea is that we have always seen leftover food after any ceremony or event which in turn is wasted while the food can be shared with poor and needy. Most of the time people thought to share their food but couldn’t find any right place or don’t have time to find it. So, this application will build a connection between the givers and takers so that they can find any nearby similar option on their fingertips and can directly contact them.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> This application will connect the givers and takers and provide a platform to easily find any nearby alternative group.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Any restaurant which has leftover food can find takers in the same city. By selecting any of them they will get all the information about the person or organization. They can directly contact them through our app only, also they will get the route to reach the selected taker’s destination.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Any NGO or group who wish to feed poor can search similar givers and based on the same city they will get a list of all the organization which offer food. They also can directly contact them with the same features.</p>
